- **CSS Grid:** Creating a diamond-like layout for the cards on larger screens.
- **Flexbox:** Aligning elements vertically and horizontally on mobile devices.
- **CSS organization:** Grouping styles logically (reset, layout, cards, typography, images, media queries) for maintainability.
- **Typography and spacing:** Using consistent fonts, line-heights, and gaps for readability.
